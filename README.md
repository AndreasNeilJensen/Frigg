# Frigg

Frigg was a examn project I had to hand in in order to prove my capabilities programming with Haskell.
The program is able to encode and decode text strings using Huffman encoding/decoding.
The comments are in danish right now, how ever, I will translate them on request.

Keywords: Haskell, Huffman, Encoding, Decoding
